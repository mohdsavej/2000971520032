# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Step 1: Setup

Create a new React application: Run npx create-react-app train-schedule-app in your terminal.
Navigate to the project folder: cd train-schedule-app.
Step 2: Components and Pages

Create a folder structure for your components: Inside the src folder, create folders like components, pages, and services.
Create the necessary components and pages: You'll need components for train lists, individual trains, and maybe a layout component for navigation.
Step 3: Consuming APIs

Create a service file to handle API calls: Inside the services folder, create a file like api.js.
Fetch data from the John Doe Railways API: Use the fetch or a library like axios to make API calls and get the train schedules.
Here's a simplified example of how an API call might look:
// src/services/api.js
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.johndoe-railways.com';

const getTrains = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/trains`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching train data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};


Step 4: Rendering Train Schedules

In your components, use the API service to fetch data.
Display the data on the UI according to the requirements: You'll need to sort and format the data based on price, availability, and departure time.
Step 5: Styling with Material-UI

Install Material-UI: Run npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled to install the Material-UI components and styles.
Import Material-UI components and styles into your components.
Apply styles to your components following Material-UI's documentation.
Step 6: README
Create a README.md file in the root directory of your project. This should contain information about how to set up and run the application, along with any other relevant details about the project. Here's a simple template:
# Train Schedule App
